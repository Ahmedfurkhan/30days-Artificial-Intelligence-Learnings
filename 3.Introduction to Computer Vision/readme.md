# Introduction to OpenCV and Computer Vision

Welcome to the Introduction to OpenCV and Computer Vision repository! This repository aims to provide you with introductory materials and examples for learning OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) and computer vision concepts.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that enables computers to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. It seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do, such as recognizing objects, understanding scenes, and detecting patterns. Computer vision has applications in various fields, including robotics, healthcare, automotive, surveillance, and augmented reality.

## What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a popular open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and algorithms to perform tasks such as image and video input/output, image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and more. OpenCV is written in C++ and has bindings for Python, Java, and other languages.

## Installation

### Windows

```bash
pip install opencv-python


### macOS

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Linux

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

#### Additional Modules (Optional)

If you need additional functionality provided by OpenCV's extra modules, you can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

## Usage

To use OpenCV in your Python code, simply import the `cv2` module:

```python
import cv2
```

You can then use the various functions and classes provided by OpenCV for image and video processing, computer vision tasks, and more.

## Examples

This repository includes example scripts and notebooks to help you get started with OpenCV. You can find them in the "examples" directory.
