# Face Emotion Recognition

This project uses computer vision to recognize and display emotions in real-time from a webcam feed.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV
- facial_emotion_recognition

## Installation

1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python facial_emotion_recognition
   ```

2. Ensure you have a working webcam connected to your device.

## Usage

Run the script:
```
python emotionRecognition.py
```

This will open a window displaying the webcam feed. The emotions recognized will be displayed above the video.


The program will open a window displaying the webcam feed with emotion labels. Press 'Esc' to exit.

## Note

The script is currently set to use the second webcam (index 1). If you only have one webcam, change `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` to `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.
