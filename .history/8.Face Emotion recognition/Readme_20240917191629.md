# Face Emotion Recognition

## Overview

This is a project for facial emotion recognition using OpenCV and deep learning techniques.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Emotion Recognition Model

The model used in this project is based on a deep neural network architecture, specifically designed to recognize human emotions from facial expressions.

The model can be fine-tuned and improved upon by modifying the `emotionRecognition.py` file.

## Running the Emotion Recognition

To run the emotion recognition, simply execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python emotionRecognition.py
```

This will start the OpenCV video capture and display the live video feed. The model will recognize the emotions and display them on the screen in real-time.

## Code Explanation

The code can be explained as follows:
```python
from facial_emotion_recognition import EmotionRecognition

import cv2

# Initialize the emotion recognition model

# Set the device to CPU for performance reasons

er = EmotionRecognition(device='cpu')

# Initialize the OpenCV video capture

cam = cv2.VideoCapture(1)

while True:
    # Read a frame from the video capture
    success, frame = cam.read()

    # Recognize the emotion and return the result as a BGR image
    frame = er.recognise_emotion(frame, return_type='BGR')

    # Display the result on the screen
    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)

    # Check for the exit key (27 is the Esc key)
    key = cv2.waitKey(1)
    if key == 27:
        break

# Release the video capture and destroy all windows

cam.release()

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This code initializes the emotion recognition model and sets up the OpenCV video capture. It then enters a loop where it reads frames from the video capture, recognizes the emotion, and displays the result on the screen. The loop can be exited by pressing the Esc key.
